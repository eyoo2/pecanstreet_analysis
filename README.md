# pecanstreet_analysis
This data science project is a time-series modeling of minute-level residential electricity data from Pecan Street (TX), to determine potential environmental drivers of peak demand.

This is a Python Jupyter notebook consisting of 3 main sections: EDA (daily power demand analysis), ARIMA-based power forecasting, and SARIMAX-based power forecasting. Analysis results, discussion, and resources are also provided at each step, similar to the format of a report.

The original Pecan Street dataset from Kaggle can be found at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pecanstreetinc/ps-data-10-homes-1min-frequency-aug-2018

# Directions
For the SARIMAX model, make sure to replace line 4 in cell 1 under the section "Weather Analysis as Driver of Peak Load." Replace with the local filepath to the directory storing this notebook.
